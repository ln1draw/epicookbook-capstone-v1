 Epicookbook is a cookbook app for busy people who care about what's in their food. It provides completely reliable recipe-searching and meal-planning services based on what you want, AND what you don't. Don't like tomatoes? Great! We won't show you any recipes with tomatoes in them. Don't know what a vegan eats? Epicookbook does. Are you having a hard time finding a recipe that is completely, 100% gluten-free? Let Epicookbook help you. We're bringing reliability and ease to the world of modern eating.

 When starting this application, I used the angular-app repo on Github as a reference to help start my first major AngularJS app. You can find it here: #[AngularJS CRUD application demo] (https://github.com/angular-app/angular-app)
